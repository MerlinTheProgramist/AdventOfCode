# [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) (in Python & JS)
```py
  aoc_year: Final[int] = 2021
```
  Its mostly a mess, but some python solutions are really neat. I didn't finish all of them.
# [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) (in C++)
```cpp
  const size_t aoc_year {2022};
```
  Only done 13 days  
# [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) (in Rust)
```rust
  const aoc_year:u32 = 2023;
```
*All the days are done*
Most days don't use cargo except day 24 and 25.   
The input file loading is hard coded, and some days have hard coded constants specific to sizes of input.   
Every solution is separate file, so build with: `rustc -r ./p1.rs`   
# [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) (in Rust)
```rust
  impl AocYear for Year2025{
    fn get_year() -> usize {2024}
  }
```
Only done 12 of the days, because of university and stuff.
# [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) (in julia & bash)
```bash
  AOC_YEAR=2025
  echo $AOC_YEAR
```
I realized that i hate bash soooo... much, im grateful this year AOC has only 12 days.

Everything was handcrafted, by me :>
