# [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) (in Rust)
```rust
  let mut aoc_year:u32 = 2023;
```
Most days don't use cargo except day 24 and 25.   
The input file loading is hard coded, and some days have hard coded constants specific to sizes of input. 
Every solution is separate file, so build with: `rustc -r ./p1.rs`
Everything was handcrafted, by me :>
